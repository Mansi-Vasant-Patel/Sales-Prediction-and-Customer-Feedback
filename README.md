# Sales-Prediction-and-Customer-Feedback
Wesite design for the application - Sales prediction & customer feedback

**##Abstract**

Taking customer feedback is important to understand user requirements. Customer feedback helps improve product development, marketing, operations, and so much more. However, It’s one of the most important aspects of running a business that often gets overlooked. Many companies could find themselves lacking sales or simply not keeping the right kind of customer base because they have not taken the time to listen to their customers as much as they should. Listening to your customers and applying those insights is the best way to move a business forward.

Sales prediction has multiple benefits. It helps in business planning. Accurate sales prediction or forecasting can help in cash optimization, inventory control, identifying trends of sales, planning production and capacity, determining the expected return on investment, and in continuous improvement.


##**Introduction**

In this project, we are creating a system that provides customer feedback analysis and sales prediction. For customer feedback analysis we will first take audio-based feedback from customers. Once the data is collected we will analyze the data and visualize it on the dashboard. For the sales prediction, we are using past sales data and training a regression model for the same. This data then will be visualized on the dashboard.


##**Dataset Description**

The weekly sales data was collected from the point-of-sale system of 10 stores and contains raw data for each item sold in each store for each week, from April 2012 through March 2013. Profit calculations are included in the dataset. The weekly sales table contains over 79,000 rows which each represent summary statistics for the sales of an individual menu item in one store during one week of the year.
